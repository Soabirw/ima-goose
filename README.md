# ima-goose

IMA's Goose recipe repository — FP-aware coding agents, WordPress development, code review, testing, and architecture guidance.

## Architecture Layers

The hybrid model uses six distinct layers. Understanding which layer does what prevents confusion and misuse.

| Layer | Mechanism | Lifecycle | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MOIM** (`GOOSE_MOIM_MESSAGE_FILE`) | Env var → injected every turn | Always-on, all sessions | 5-10 line persona anchor that survives `/compact` |
| **Recipe instructions** | YAML `instructions:` | Loaded once per session | Persona pointer + workflow + sub-recipe orchestration |
| **Skills** (`~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) | Summon extension, auto-discovered | Frontmatter always loaded, body on-demand | Deep domain knowledge — FP patterns, framework rules, brand |
| **Sub-recipes** (`sub_recipes:` YAML) | Tool per child, parent invokes by call | Spawn on tool call; fresh session, own pinned model | Deterministic delegation with parameters |
| **Subagents** (natural-language) | "Use the X recipe to…" in instructions | Spawned ad-hoc, own context | Parallel ad-hoc work without a YAML contract |
| **`settings.goose_model`** | YAML field per recipe | Per-recipe pin | Opus orchestrate, Sonnet implement, Haiku explore |

**Key point:** The orchestrator extension is *session management* (list/view/interrupt sessions) — it is NOT the delegation engine. Delegation is sub-recipes and subagents.

## Setup

### 1. Configure Goose Provider

The team's current default routes Goose through your Claude Code subscription via the ACP provider — no separate API costs.

**Claude ACP (team default):**
```yaml
# ~/.config/goose/config.yaml
GOOSE_PROVIDER: "claude-acp"
GOOSE_MODEL: "sonnet"
GOOSE_PLANNER_PROVIDER: "claude-acp"
GOOSE_PLANNER_MODEL: "default"   # maps to opus
```

Friendly model names: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `default` (= opus). Recipes pin their own model via `settings.goose_model`; the global is the fallback.

**Alternatives** (if you're not on Claude Code subscription):

```yaml
# Direct Anthropic
GOOSE_PROVIDER: "anthropic"
GOOSE_MODEL: "claude-sonnet-4-6"

# OpenRouter (multi-provider routing)
GOOSE_PROVIDER: "openrouter"
GOOSE_MODEL: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"

# RunPod (self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible)
GOOSE_PROVIDER: "openai"
OPENAI_HOST: "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint-id>"
OPENAI_API_KEY: "<your-runpod-key>"
GOOSE_MODEL: "your-deployed-model"
```

If you switch providers, the model strings in recipes (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`) will need to swap to the matching format for that provider.

### 2. Connect Recipe Repository

```bash
goose configure
# goose settings → goose recipe github repo → Soabirw/ima-goose
```

Or add to config.yaml:
```yaml
GOOSE_RECIPE_GITHUB_REPO: "Soabirw/ima-goose"
```

### 3. Enable Required Extensions

```bash
goose configure
# Toggle Extensions → enable: developer, summon
```

`developer` provides file/shell access. `summon` auto-discovers skills from `~/.agents/skills/`.

### 4. Install Skills

```bash
node scripts/install.ts
```

Copies all 40 skills from `skills/` to `~/.agents/skills/`. Requires Node 24+.

### 5. (Optional) Enable MOIM Persona Anchor

Source `.goose-aliases.example` and uncomment the `GOOSE_MOIM_MESSAGE_FILE` export to inject the Practitioner persona into every Goose turn. This survives context compaction.

### 6. Run a Recipe

```bash
# By name (from configured repo)
goose run --recipe implement

# By local path
goose run --recipe ./implement/recipe.yaml

# Preview without executing
goose run --recipe implement --explain

# Interactive mode
goose run --recipe implement --interactive
```

---

## Skills

Skills live in `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and are auto-discovered by the **Summon** extension at session start. Summon keeps only the frontmatter in initial context and loads the body on-demand when the task matches — keeping context lean.

**Skills vs Recipes:** Recipes launch standalone sessions with a pinned model and workflow. Skills are deep domain knowledge — FP patterns, framework rules, brand guidelines — loaded into running sessions on demand.

**Cross-platform:** The same SKILL.md format works in Claude Code (via the Summon extension) and Goose. Write a skill once, use it in both.

**Slash commands:** `/skills` lists available skills. `/prompts` and `/prompt <n>` exist for prompt templates.

### Installed Skills (40 total)

**FP languages (5):** `functional-programmer`, `js-fp`, `php-fp`, `py-fp`, `ruby-fp`

**FP framework variants (6):** `js-fp-api`, `js-fp-react`, `js-fp-vue`, `js-fp-wordpress`, `php-fp-wordpress`, `rails`

**WordPress / IMA framework (5):** `ima-bootstrap`, `ima-forms-expert`, `jquery`, `livecanvas`, `wp-ddev` / `wp-local`

**Editorial / brand (4):** `ima-brand`, `ima-copywriting`, `ima-editorial-scorecard`, `ima-editorial-workflow`

**Workflow / git / arch (3):** `ima-git`, `architect`, `gh-cli`

**Testing (3):** `unit-testing`, `phpunit-wp`, `playwright`

**MCP guides (9):** `mcp-tavily`, `mcp-context7`, `mcp-sequential-thinking`, `mcp-atlassian`, `mcp-serena`, `mcp-fetch`, `mcp-chrome-devtools`, `mcp-qdrant`, `mcp-vestige`

**Other domain (5):** `discourse`, `espocrm`, `php-authnet`, `rg`, `ima-git`

Load a skill explicitly: `"Load the php-fp-wordpress skill with summon"`. Or just work naturally — Summon matches by description.

## Available Recipes

### P1/P2 — Core Recipes (All 10 Refactored)

All 10 recipes are refactored to the hybrid pattern: each pins `settings.goose_model`, declares `extensions: [developer, summon]`, references skills by name in instructions, and uses `sub_recipes:` for declarative delegation where natural.

| Recipe | Description | Model |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `implement` | General-purpose FP-aware coding | Sonnet 4.6 |
| `code-review` | Read-only FP + security review | Opus 4.7 |
| `wp-developer` | WordPress with security + Bootstrap + FP | Sonnet 4.6 |
| `explore` | Fast read-only codebase exploration | Haiku 4.5 |
| `test-writer` | TDD, test creation, debugging failures | Sonnet 4.6 |
| `architect` | Architecture guidance and technology selection | Opus 4.7 |
| `task-master` | Orchestration via sub-recipe delegation | Opus 4.7 |
| `task-planner` | Detailed implementation planning | Opus 4.7 |
| `task-runner` | Execute detailed task plans | Sonnet 4.6 |
| `prompt-starter` | Rough idea to structured prompt | Opus 4.7 |

### Sub-Recipe Wiring

`task-master` delegates to: `implement`, `wp_implement` (wp-developer), `write_tests` (test-writer), `code_review` (code-review), `explore`, `plan_task` (task-planner).

`implement` and `wp-developer` delegate to: `write_tests`, `code_review`.

`task-runner` delegates to: `write_tests`, `code_review`.

Terminal (no sub-recipes): `code-review`, `architect`, `task-planner`, `prompt-starter`, `test-writer`, `explore`.

### P3 — Specialized (Stubs — Planned)

| Recipe | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `project-planner` | Epic > Story > Task decomposition |
| `espocrm` | EspoCRM API integration |
| `design-to-code` | Screenshot to WordPress code |
| `scorecard` | Project quality scorecard |

### P4 — Domain-Specific (Stubs — Planned)

| Recipe | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `quasar-developer` | Quasar Framework + Vue FP |
| `livecanvas` | LiveCanvas + Bootstrap + Tangible |
| `payment-processing` | Authorize.Net PHP SDK |
| `jira-workflow` | Jira awareness checkpoints |
| `email-creator` | Branded email HTML |

P3/P4 stubs are harmless empty dirs signaling future scope. Convert when the workflow surfaces.

## Model Pinning

Each recipe pins its own model via `settings.goose_model`. No global tier table needed — the recipe carries the right model for the job.

| Recipe | Model | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `task-master` | `opus` | Orchestration / decisions |
| `architect` | `opus` | Trade-off reasoning |
| `prompt-starter` | `opus` | Research + template fill |
| `task-planner` | `opus` | Decomposition |
| `code-review` | `opus` | Security + logic flaws |
| `implement` | `sonnet` | Coding |
| `wp-developer` | `sonnet` | Coding |
| `test-writer` | `sonnet` | Test coding |
| `task-runner` | `sonnet` | Execution |
| `explore` | `haiku` | Cheap read-only |

The `settings.goose_model` field uses `claude-acp` friendly names (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku` / `default`). If you switch to Anthropic direct (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, etc.) or OpenRouter (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`), update the recipe pins accordingly. Override at run time with `--model` if needed.

---

## MOIM — Persistent Persona Anchor

`moim/ima-practitioner.md` is a ≤10-line persona anchor injected into every Goose turn via `GOOSE_MOIM_MESSAGE_FILE`. Unlike recipe instructions (loaded once at session start), MOIM re-injects every turn and survives `/compact`.

Opt-in by sourcing `.goose-aliases.example` and uncommenting the export. Off by default — non-IMA Goose sessions are unaffected.

---

## Shared Reference Files

`shared/` contains recipe-internal references used by the developer extension at runtime. Domain knowledge (FP patterns, brand, framework rules) now lives in skills — shared/ is intentionally slim.

```
shared/
├── persona.md              # Practitioner persona (also in moim/)
├── security-guardrails.md  # Consolidated security checks
└── tool-guides/
    ├── tea.md              # Gitea CLI reference
    └── atlassian.md        # Jira/Confluence patterns
```

---

## Per-Project Hints

Copy `.goosehints` to your project repos for persistent project context. Goose reads it at session start — same role as CLAUDE.md in Claude Code. It covers tool preferences, architecture notes, security requirements, and framework constraints.

---

## Origin

Adapted from [ima-claude](https://github.com/Soabirw/ima-claude) (Claude Code plugin, 63 skills). This repo packages the same team standards and FP patterns in Goose's recipe + skills hybrid format. Skills are cross-installed: the same SKILL.md files serve both Claude Code (via Summon extension) and Goose (via Summon built-in).
